Ultrapack 3.3

Installation:
Download all parts of the installer (5 in total).
Run the installer ("Ultrapack 3.3 Bigfoot.part1.exe") and let the installer do it's job.
At the end, JSGME will open up. "#UP#_Enable_UP3.3" (that's Ultrapack 3.3 "Bigfoot") will be enabled automatically and you can choose additional JSGME Options as you like.
ATTENTION: Do _NOT_ enable "#UP#_Enable_UP3.0" and/or "#UP#_Enable_UP3.2", there's no need to anymore, it's outdated.

##################################################################################################################

Old readme from last Patch Pack (303) below:

Contents:
- All fixes listed below
- All feature enhancements listed below
- SAS Common Utils v1.10
- SFS AutoMount v2
- IL-2 Selector 3.5.0

Included feature enhancements:
- Replication of aircraft control surfaces movement over the net and through NTRK recordings
- Replication of pilot head movement over the net and through NTRK recordings
- Animated AI pilot heads, according to pilot's task (watch wing leader, watch enemy etc.)
- Screenshots taken in native code, much faster than before
- "Stabs4All" included, can be activated through conf.ini (*)
- New DiffFM included, capable of reading different FM file versions, less intrusive
- I-16 Planes can hook to TB-3 SPB bombers in flight.
  Hook Parameters on Ground: Distance to hook point max. 5m
  Hook Parameters in Air: Distance to hook point max. 15m, speed difference max. 30km/h, flight vector difference max. 25 degrees
- G4M-2 and Ohka flying bomb can be hooked to each other on ground now (max. distance to hook point: 50m)

  New "smooth" Torpedo Engagement Limits,
  Random Bomb, Rocket, Ordnance drop spread,
  bouncing bombs on water (skip-bombing),
  Detonation Delay (Bomb fuze) settings and

(*) Me-262V3 flight model:
    Like in real life, you have to tap the brakes in order to get the 262V3 off the ground.
    Let the plane accelerate to 180km/h, tap the brakes until the tail comes up and you will soon get airborne automatically.
    Remember to move the throttle gently below 6000rpm.
    VERY GENTLY!
    This plane is equipped with very early stages of the Jumo 004 jet engines which are still under development.
    The specified spool up time from idle to full throttle is ==>> 40 Seconds <<==
    This means that e.g. when using keyboard for throttle, you're allowed to increase throttle by one step (=5%) every 2 seconds only !!
    You might be lucky and manage to spool up within half of that time (20 seconds) but we cannot guarantee that the engines will survive it.
    If you spool up any faster, your engines will go up in flames, mark these words!
    The same applies when you throttle back: GENTLY!
    You can do it quicker than throttling up, actually about twice as fast, but you still have to do it GENTLY once you fall below 6000rpm.
    That much for the bad news about the engines, the good news is that above 6000rpm you can move the throttle as quick as you like.
    Watch your RPMs!

    Note: * Trim setting for ground start is "full up".
            It will be applied automatically on ground start, however if you have a joystick axis attached for elevator trim,
            remember to trim up all the way when you start on ground, otherwise you risk to nose over when you tap the brakes.
          * Don't let the plane accelerate beyond 200 km/h without lifting the tail.
            Otherwise eventually the wings might lift the plane into the air (especially with low fuel load),
            but you have no elevator authority yet since they're still wing alee: -> Crash.
          * Don't tap the brakes too soon when you try to lift the tail.
            If you do so below ~160km/h, the tail will come up, but since you don't have sufficient elevator authority yet, your plane will nose over.

    ATTENTION: If you have installed PA_Jeronimo's Engine Cowling Mod, please deactivate the Me-262V-3 folder inside of that mod, otherwise
               Your engine will get damage once started on ground, see deactivation details below.

Additionally implemented Debugging Switches:
You can adjust log.lst debugging by setting the following values in the conf.ini [Mods] section:

DEBUG_ZSM_BUILDER=<0/1>    ZutiSupportMethods_Builder enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable

DEBUG_ZSM=<0/1>            ZutiSupportMethods enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable

DEBUG_USER=<0/1>           User enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
DEBUG_TORPEDO=<0/1>        Torpedo enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
DEBUG_ZSM_GAMEORDER=<0/1>  ZutiSupportMethods_GameOrder enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
DEBUG_ZSM_ENGINE=<0/1>     ZutiSupportMethods_Engine enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
DEBUG_GEAR=<0-2>           Gear enhanced debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable, 2=detailed, useful for carrier takeoff mod debugging
DEBUG_NETAIRCRAFT=<0/1>    NetAircraft debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable, useful e.g. for weapon trigger replication
DEBUG_BOMB=<0/1>           Bomb debugging, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable, useful e.g. for Bomb Fuze / Delay replication (also for Torps and Rockets)

Additionally implemented Logfile Switches:
You can adjust log.lst Date/Time output by setting the following values in the conf.ini [Mods] section:

LogDate=<0/1>              Date output in log.lst, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
LogMilliseconds=<0/1>      Milliseconds in time output in log.lst, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable
LogTicks=<0/1>             "Tick Delta" output in log.lst, default=0, 0=disable, 1=enable, this is the time difference between two log lines in game's internal "Ticks"
InstantLog=<0/1/2>         Instant Logging support. "0" uses Stock IL-2 Logging, "1" uses old (slow) Instant Logging, "2" uses new "Piped" Instand Logging (available since PP 303)
